# Sxmurai/Oka - Information

Welcome to the Oka github repo. I honestly don't care if you clone this, but you'll need a few things.
For the commands, they might need some API keys.

  - [IPInfoDB](https://ipinfodb.com/api)
  - [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
  - [Discord Token](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)
  
Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I need to go through from stuff.

This bot is not meant for self-hosting, but you can do so yourself! All you need to do is clone the repo, and install a few **needed** modules. 

  - [Discord-Akairo](https://discord-akairo.github.io/#/) (npm install discord-akairo/discord-akairo)
  - [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) (npm install discordjs/discord.js)
  - [Node-Fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) (npm install node-fetch)
  
These are the main modules. Just check out [package.json](https://github.com/Sxmurai/Oka/blob/master/package.json) to get the rest of the modules.

This is also in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It is compiled into JavaScript, which is then what you run with node.
You simply run: **tsc** in the console to compile the code. Be sure to check out the [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/Sxmurai/Oka/blob/master/tsconfig.json).

Want to enjoy the bot without cloning the repo? Here is an invite link to [Oka](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=663077021487988746&scope=bot&permissions=8). I'll add some more shit soon.

Anyway, thats the introduction to Oka. Duces
